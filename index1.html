    <h1>IRP Journal Entry #1</h1>
    <p>
        The reason I chose to read Yoko Ogawa’s The Memory Police was to give myself that final push I needed to get into Japanese literature. 
        For a while, I’ve been intrigued by the unique storytelling and subtle emotional depth present in Japanese fiction, but I hadn’t fully read it myself. 
        The Memory Police was particularly caught due to its Japanese origins and dystopian setting, ideas I've encountered before in Orwell's 1984. 
        The novel’s exploration of how the modification of memories affects identity and reality drew me in, as I’ve always been fascinated by the fragility of human experience in the face of external forces. 
        I’m also intrigued by Ogawa’s sparse prose mirroring the growing absence that takes hold of the characters’ lives, a writing style I’d love to analyze further. 
        I hope this book not only deepens my understanding of Japanese literature but also allows me to reflect on the ways societies manipulate memory for control, a theme I believe is highly relevant today.
